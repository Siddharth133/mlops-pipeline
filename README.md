MLOps Pipeline with Java, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Prometheus
=============================================================================

Overview
--------

This project implements a complete MLOps pipeline that combines Java for backend services, Python for machine learning tasks, and integrates modern DevOps tools for continuous integration, deployment, and monitoring. The pipeline is designed to manage the entire lifecycle of a machine learning model, from training to deployment and retraining, while ensuring scalability and monitoring.

Key Features
------------

*   **Backend:** A Spring Boot-based Java application that serves as the backend API for handling requests and providing model predictions.
*   **Machine Learning Pipeline:** A Python-based ML pipeline that trains and retrains models, with Docker support for containerization.
*   **Docker:** All components (Java backend, Python ML pipeline) are containerized using Docker, ensuring portability across different environments.
*   **Kubernetes:** The backend service is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster for scalability and resilience.
*   **CI/CD with Jenkins:** Continuous integration and deployment pipelines are set up using Jenkins, automating the process of building, testing, and deploying code.
*   **Monitoring:** The system is monitored using Prometheus and Grafana to collect and visualize metrics for better observability and performance analysis.
*   **Airflow:** Orchestrates workflows for retraining models and handling data pipelines.

Technologies Used
-----------------

*   **Java:** For backend development and serving model predictions.
*   **Python:** For machine learning tasks such as training, model retraining, and data processing.
*   **Docker:** Containerizes the application components for ease of deployment.
*   **Kubernetes:** Manages and scales the application components.
*   **Jenkins:** For CI/CD automation.
*   **Prometheus:** Monitors system metrics.
*   **Grafana:** Visualizes system performance and metrics.
*   **Airflow:** Manages data pipelines and model retraining workflows.

Setup Instructions
------------------

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mlops-pipeline-java-python.git

Navigate to the project folder:

    cd mlops-pipeline-java-python

Build and run the Docker containers for the Java backend and ML pipeline:

*   `docker build -t mlops-backend:1.0 ./docker`
*   `docker build -t mlops-ml-pipeline:1.0 ./ml_pipeline`

Deploy the application on Kubernetes:

*   `kubectl apply -f kubernetes/backend-deployment.yaml`
*   `kubectl apply -f kubernetes/backend-service.yaml`

Set up Jenkins for CI/CD and configure Prometheus for monitoring.

How It Works
------------

*   **Training:** The ML pipeline is triggered to train a model on the dataset.
*   **Deployment:** Once the model is trained, the backend API is updated to serve predictions using the latest model.
*   **Retraining:** Periodic retraining is triggered by Airflow, ensuring the model remains up to date with new data.

Future Enhancements
-------------------

*   Implement model versioning for better management of model deployments.
*   Add more sophisticated data processing and model training pipelines.
*   Expand monitoring with additional metrics and alerts.
